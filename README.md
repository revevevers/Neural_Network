# Ultrasound ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

-  Processing ultrasonic signal to characterize damage in some material using python.
-  Choose python is because I concerning use some neural methods to process data.
-  But I may also record some programs that use Matlab for signal processing here, because using Matlab seems to be more suitable for the topic I am doing.
-  Considering the lab equipment, my data format will generally be time domain signals.
-  In short, I will try to do signal processing here, and maybe I will create another project to deploy large models and website development. Welcome to contact me and discuss with me.‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è
